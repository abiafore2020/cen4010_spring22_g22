            <h5>About Me</h5>
            <p>
            My name is Max Rothman and I am a Computer Engineering student here at FAU!  Originally studied up in Orlando at UCF for business, 
            but later transferred here and switched majors.  My main interest is in embedded systems, or purpose built computers; think anything that
            has a cpu but isn't ordinarily considered a "computer" e.g. smart appliances, medical devices, walkie talkies, etc.  Being that I'm interested
            in embedded systems, C is my most comfortable language currently, although I plan to learn some Java and Python on the side just to round myself out.

      <h5>About me</h5>
          <p>
           Born and raised right here in South Florida, my main interests are barefoot running (specifically trail running!), rock climbing, 
           hiking, anime, and competitive video games, although just about anything outdoorsy and active does it for me! I also love travelling; some of my 
           favorite places I've been to are Bend OR, Lake Tahoe CA, Ogden UT, Whistler CA, and Boulder CO.  If I didn't have to worry about money/won the lottery,
           I'd probably be living in a van right now travelling cross country!
