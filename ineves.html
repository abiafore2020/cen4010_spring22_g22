            <h5>About Me & My Major:</h5>
            <p>
                My name is Ines and I am a Junior student here at FAU. I am currently majoring in Computer Science
            with a minor in Artificial Intelligence and a Data Science Cerfiticate. I took my very first programming
            class back in high school, where we used Python to create games and make robots move and I thought it was 
            so cool and I wanted to learn more! I also believe that technology is only growing and it would be beneficial 
            for me to understand it and be able to work with it. I have experience in Python, C, and C++ but Python is definintely my favorite language.
            I am not the best coder but I am actively learning and getting better. I should be graduating in the Spring of 2024, although I'm still not sure
            what I want to do, but I know my opportunities are endless!

      <h5>Some Facts About Me:</h5>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in Portugal, but I have been all over the place. My dad is a Project Manager at Microsoft Federal, so we have spent the last
            10 years moving around to different countries so he can persue different roles within his company.  I have lived in Ireland, Reno, NV, and now Florida! 
            However, I do want to leave Florida most likely after graduation and live somewhere that has cold. Some of my favorite things include going to the beach,
            going to the movies, sunsets, watching soccer, and working. My favorite musical artist is Harry Styles, and I have a tattoo dedicated to him and his music. 
            I am a big family person; family is the single most important thing to me and I'm so grateful to have them. 
            I also have a 13 year old dog! He's half german shepard, half golden retriver and he's my little world.
            I am so excited and terrified to see where the future is going to take me, and I am looking forward to meeting and working with all of you!
