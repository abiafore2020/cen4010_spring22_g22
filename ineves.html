          <p>
           My name is Ines and I am a Junior student here at FAU. I am currently majoring in Computer Science
            with a minor in Artificial Intelligence and a Data Science Cerfiticate. I took my very first programming
            class back in high school, where we used Python to create games and make robots move and I thought it was 
            so cool and I wanted to learn more! I also believe that technology is only growing and it would be beneficial 
            for me to understand it and be able to work with it; the opportunities would be endless! I am not the best coder
            but I am actively learning and getting better.
