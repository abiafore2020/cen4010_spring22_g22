            <p>
            My name is Elias Fatta. I'm a computer science major at FAU hoping to graudate the end of the year. I was majoring in something else until I decided to switch to C.S. a few years ago. I was born in Trinidad, but moved to Florida almost immediately where I've spent the majority of my life growing up. I enjoy problem-solving, so being faced with a problem and running through it with trial-and-error until I get a solution is something I'm interested in. That's primarily how I've practiced and learned to code. I'm not sure what specific area/field I'll end up going to, but I'm very open to everything and still exploring to see what exactly fits best for me.

      <h5>More About Me:</h5>
          <p>
              I enjoy playing and watching basketball, football, soccer, etc.. during my free time. I actually started an IG in high school page analzying the NBA that has around ~31k followers, so I think that's pretty cool. I also like to play video games, go to the gym, etc... it would be fun to travel around the world. It's a goal of mine to learn around 4-5 languages (haven't made a lot of progress yet though), but maybe one day! Hope we all have a great semester.
