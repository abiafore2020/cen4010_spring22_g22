          <p>
            My name is Angelina Biafore and I'm a member of Group 22 in Dr Shihong Huang's CEN 4010 class. 
            I am a junior studying Computer Science at FAU and have been here since last fall! I originally went to
            the University of Rhode Island but transferred here. I also used to be a biology major but didn't enjoy
            chem and siwtched after taking my first programming class at URI. In that class we focused on HTML, CSS and Javascript
            which became my favorite things to code. I love the front end aspect of coding and making visual things! I'm the Web Director
            for our school's radio station, Owl Radio and created the website they used, but used Squarespace since I'm not too good at HTML to make
            a good looking website. I hope to go into video game design or something similar since I like how creative I get to be.

            I am originally from Rhode Island and grew up there. Some of my favorite things to do include skiing, yoga, reading and swimming! I love
            getting outside but am still getting used to the Florida heat. I have two dogs, Henry and Ollie who I adore but I would love to 
            have my own cat whenever I get to live somewhere that allows them! I have always wanted to try moving out of the country, maybe to
            Italy or Switzerland, so I do my daily DuoLingo! Haha but no joke, I have a 45 day streak and I would cry if I lost it. My favorite food
            is definitely pasta (I'm Italian) and making my own food is one of the daily routines I enjoy most. I would love to write my own cookbook
            some day, not that anyone would buy it but I think it would be cute. If modern society wasn't a thing I think I'd be a small gardener and take
            care of cows in Wisconsin near a big mountain and a lake.
