            <p>
            My name is Alfonso Avila and I am one of the members of Group 22 in the class CEN 4010-002: Principles of Software Engineering by Dr. Shihong Huang.
            I am a computer science major and I am currently in my junior year. I have attended FAU since Fall 2021. Additionally, I was born in Cuba, but I 
            moved to Florida in 2014 when I was eleven years old and it has been my home ever since. I went to West Boca High School and I was in an academy called 
            "Drafting and Design", where we did a lot of work with Photoshop and Illustrator. Thanks to the professor of the academy I was able to find a job as 
            soon as I finished high school with a company called Integrated Supply in the promotional products industry. I got introduced to coding and a very 
            little overview of the computer science world by some of my friends in high school who were in the computer science academy and since then it became 
            what I wanted to study in college. I am still not sure on what area of CS I want to focus on, but I would love it to be on something creative where I
            could mix coding with graphic design.
