            <h5>About Me</h5>
            <p>
            My name is Alfonso Avila and I am one of the members of Group 22 in the class CEN 4010-002: Principles of Software Engineering by Dr. Shihong Huang.
            I am a computer science major and I am currently in my junior year. I have attended FAU since Fall 2021. Additionally, I was born in Cuba, but I 
            moved to Florida in 2014 when I was eleven years old and it has been my home ever since. I went to West Boca High School and I was in an academy called 
            "Drafting and Design", where we did a lot of work with Photoshop and Illustrator. Thanks to the professor of the academy I was able to find a job as 
            soon as I finished high school with a company called Integrated Supply in the promotional products industry. I got introduced to coding and a very 
            little overview of the computer science world by some of my friends in high school who were in the computer science academy and since then it became 
            what I wanted to study in college. I am still not sure on what area of CS I want to focus on, but I would love it to be on something creative where I
            could mix coding with graphic design.

     <h5>Some Other Facts About Me</h5>
         <p>
         As I mentioned earlier, I was born in Cuba, more specifically in a province called "Las Tunas". I lived there until 2014, which was when my parents and I came
         to live in FLorida. Luckily I had studied English before coming here so that the difference would not be so huge. Additionally, we also came to the U.S. with
         our dogs Yoni and Susy. Some of my favorite things to do are watching films and playing video games, especially when I can do them in the company of others
         and not just by myself. Personally, I was always fascinated by movies since I was little and that is one of the areas in which I would love to apply the field
         of computer science. Maybe using Unreal Engine 5 for the CGI or other designs, etc.
